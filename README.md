# Algorithms-javascript
List of classic alogithms on javascript which every programmer should know. I put some links to problems with every algorithm, so you can practice with it. Algorithms it'a fundamental tool to be a Software Engeneer.

## Dynamic programming
1. [Change coin problem](https://github.com/tmdautov/algorithms-javascript/blob/master/dp/changeCoinProblem.js). Given n coins and total sum which need to get. Find number of ways to get total sum.
2. [Max rectangle in matrix](https://github.com/tmdautov/algorithms-javascript/blob/master/dp/maxRectangleInMatrix.js). Given binary matrix. Find max submatrix of 1.
3. [Longest common subsequence]()

## Graph theory
1. [Number of edges with dfs](). Given a undirected graph. Find number of edges.
2. [Topological sort](). Given a graph. Sort nodes in ascending order.
3. [Tarjan algorithm]().


## Geometry
1. [Convex hull]()
